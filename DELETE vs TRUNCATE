Both used to delete data, 
DELETE is a Database Manipulation Language (DML) command, 
while TRUNCATE is a Data Definition Language (DDL) command.

  - DELETE is used to remove specific data from a table, while TRUNCATE removes all the rows of a table without maintaining the structure of the table.
  - DELETE can be used with the WHERE clause, but TRUNCATE cannot. 
  - DELETE TABLE would remove all the data from the table, while maintaining the structure. TRUNCATE would delete the entire table.
